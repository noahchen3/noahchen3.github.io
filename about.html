        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>I have a deep passion for technology, data analytics, basketball, and the general goal of using data-driven 
           methodology to strive to optimize strategic decision. Whether it be optimizing financial investment strategies, 
           or enhancing business operations, I enjoy finding patterns in data that lead to actionable solutions. I have a
           particular interest in analytics, which has fueled my recent projects of quantifying and storing climate
           change data in a MySQL workbench database, and using machine learning to predict NBA team performance. 
           Beyond analytics, I have a strong background in collaboration through my role at Nordstrom as a logistic processor. 
           As a logistic processor, I had to manage the inventory and concerns of over 10 departments and their managers, and 
           provided me with experience in a professional workplace. 
           I relish the opportunities to work on team-based projects, where diverse perspectives lead to more comprehensive 
           products. 
           Collaboration is another key aspect of my growth. I enjoy working on team-based projects, where diverse 
           perspectives help refine ideas and lead to more effective problem-solving.
           I am excited to continue to hone my skillset and maximize what is possible with technology 
           and data, and serve as a bridge between raw data and practical solutions and actions.
