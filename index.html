        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Noah. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, trying new food, 
           and playing basketball.
           Currently, I'm honing my skills in data science, 
           database systems, and algorithmic problem-solving, building projects that range from indexing large 
           datasets to designing relational databases for real-world applications. 
           Whether it's optimizing search structures or structuring complex data relationships, 
           I enjoy tackling technical challenges with a strategic mindset. 
           Beyond my technical expertise, I value collaboration and adaptability. 
           Through my role at Nordstrom, the experiences have shaped my ability to work across diverse teams 
           and communicate complex ideas effectively. When I'm not delving into data analysis or learning about new complex 
           data structures, I can be expected to be exploring the intersections of my learnings and my personal interests.
           One of these intersections is fantasy basketball, in which I hone my game theory through experimentation and
           attention to detail, requiring risk-assessment, predictive modeling, and general strategic decision-making. 
           Additionally, I create social media content related to both fantasy basketball and general NBA analytics, 
           engaging with a community of basketball fans who share my enthusiasm for data-driven decision-making in sports.
           Beyond all of these interests, I like to stay open to new experiences, and treat each one as an opportunity for
           learning and growth.
